## ðŸ’¼ Career
**Freelance App Developer (2018 - present)**

I have done many small projects in developing Web Apps  for clients. I have completed two web app projects for Local Goverments. I was using few syntaxs and tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, JSON and CodeIgniter for my web app projects have done. I understand Laravel, Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQLMap, MongoDB, VPS, HTMX, Postgres, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, React, NextJS, Auth, Arduino Code, C, C++, Django, Flutter, Docker, Rust, Git and Linux. Becoming such a fast learner in tech I have often analysed lots of Client's code projects to add new features then. In 2021, i have assembled tools using ESP8266 Wi-Fi MCU and Arduino IDE for measuring the Air Quality Index which the generated numbers were sent to the secure website by programmed codes.
