## Hello all ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Novi Hardiansyah. Call me Novi, Omesh or whatever you want :D (just kidding buddy). I'm a specialist in Backend Engineering and a Former Coding Instructor at LKP (Lembaga Kursus dan Pelatihan).

## ðŸ’¼ Career
**Freelance App Developer (2018 - present)**

I have done many small projects in developing Web Apps for clients. I have finished two web app projects for Local Goverments. I was using few syntaxs and tools such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL and CodeIgniter for my web app projects have done. I understand Python, Laravel, Arduino Code, C, C++, Django and Flutter. Becoming such a fast learner in tech I have often analysed lots of Client's code projects to add new features then. 
In 2021, i have assembled tools using ESP8266 Wi-Fi MCU and Arduino IDE for measuring the Air Quality Index which the generated numbers were sent to the secure website by programmed codes.
